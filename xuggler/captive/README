This directory contains a series of software packages
that FFmpeg will use, along with FFmpeg itself.

The system works by building all the other projects,
and installing them in a fake location, and then building
FFmpeg.  In that way, you can be sure that FFmpeg sees
the exact versions of libraries included in this package.

Finally, a "make install" will install FFmpeg and all dependent
libraries into the location you specify.
