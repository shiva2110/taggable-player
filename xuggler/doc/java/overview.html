Xuggle: To encode, decode, and generally juggle audio and video
files in any way that you want.
<h2>MediaTool: Decoding, Encoding and View Media Files the Easy Way</h2>
The MediaTool API is a simple
API that uses Xuggler behind the scenes, but allows you to extract
pictures and audio from media files without being a complete Xuggler
expert.
<p>How simple?  Here's some code to open a MPEG video file,
convert it to an Adobe Flash Video file:</p>
<pre>
IMediaReader reader = ToolFactory.newReader("input.mpg");
reader.addListener(ToolFactory.newWriter("output.flv", reader));
while (reader.readPacket() == null)
  ;
</pre>
<p> And if for some reason, you want access to the underlying
Xuggler objects, it'll let you at them too.</p>
<p>See {@link com.xuggle.mediatool} for the Java doc or
<a href="http://wiki.xuggle.com/MediaTool_Introduction">MediaTools Introduction</a> for
a full tutorial.</p>

<h2>Xuggler: Decode, Encode and Experience Video</h2>
Sometimes you need to get at the raw bits and bytes.  For that, there's
Xuggler: A Java Library for encoding and decoding pretty much any Internet
available audio or video file. See {@link com.xuggle.xuggler}
<p>This Java library is a wrapper around the excellent <a
  href="http://ffmpeg.org"> FFMPEG</a> libav* libraries. It allows Java
developers (after installing the Xuggler native libraries) to encode and
decode video files, but in a very Java-like way (i.e. automatic garbage
collection, and fewer ways to cause bad crashes).</p>
<p>Read more about {@link com.xuggle.xuggler the details here} or
jump straight to the <a
  href="{@docRoot}/src-html/com/xuggle/xuggler/Converter.html">
com.xuggle.xuggler.Converter</a> program source code for an example of
Xuggler converting a media file.</p>

<h2>Xuggler IO: When you need your own IO</h2>
A Java Library for allowing people to plug in custom data sources for
Xuggler to use. See {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.io}
<p>Xuggler uses FFMPEG's libav libraries to do the encoding and
decoding of fils. By default FFMPEG can read files, and some other
protocols (like http), but it implements all IO itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately FFMPEG comes with a way to extend the data sources it
can read; unfortunately it's a call back mechanism. Still, the Xuggler
IO library allows you to implement IO callbacks for FFMPEG in the
language of your choice (Java) as opposed to native C code.</p>
<p>See the {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.io.FileProtocolHandler
FileProtocolHandler} for a Java example of this (really just
re-implements FFMPEG's file:// IO for illustration purposes).</p>
<p>Or better yet, check out the <a
  href="http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/red5">Xuggler Red5 Adapter</a> for
an example of a Xuggler IO plugin that allows the <a
  href="http://red5.googlecode.com/">Red5</a> Open Source Media Server
to decode and re-encode video files on the the fly (really).</p>
<h2>Ferry: Bridging the Java / C++ Gap</h2>
A set of Java classes for
<i>ferrying</i>
data to and from native code. See {@link com.xuggle.ferry}
<p><a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, an excellent utility for
wrapping native code for other languages does a lot of great things. But
sometimes it can use some help, and that's where this library comes in.
This library implements the reference-counting memory scheme (used by
the {@link com.xuggle.xuggler Xuggler} package) to allow native code to
pass objects in to other languages and relatively seamlessly integrate
with their garbage collection systems. It also provides mechanism for
allocating memory from the other language (instead of the C++ heap) to
help that language keep track of memory, mechanisms for logging in the
other language, and mechanisms for allowing the other language to
directly modify C++/C memory (if possible). Most people won't use this
outside of the Xuggler library, but if you're curious, go digging. It
relies HEAVILY on SWIG for a lot of the heavy lifting.
<h1>Licensing</h1>
<p>Our intention in open sourcing these libraries is to break down
the walls of communication between people. To that end, a lot of these
libraries deal with getting at raw data for different systems, and for
helping people to share and create cool stuff using that data.</p>
<p>That said, it is not our intent to encourage people to use these
libraries for illegal purposes, and we explicitly encourage people to
respect the rights of others when they use these libraries.</p>

. See the COPYING file in each library for details.  However, depending
on how you compile FFmpeg, Xuggler may become GPL (basically if you're
making a GPL version of FFmpeg, then Xuggler is GPL as well).
