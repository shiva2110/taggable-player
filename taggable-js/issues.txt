open Issues:

1. tag gable player created without "position:absolute" not displaying search results properly.
1. Results located at the same place is more cluttered as it shows all the results that are similar
2. Need to write unit tests, look at what others have done, for example: video.js
3. Videojs, angular.js etc. uses grunt and node.js for build and automation. Need to check on that.

4. Need an easier way to deploy contents to ec2 server.
5. Add grunt js for testing
6. Improve search algo
7. Make it workable for audio
8. Improve UI if possible
9. It would be useful to add tagging inside the video content, like selecting elements within the video (imagine a equation or object) and adding tags.
10. It would be very useful if personal tags can be shown. For example: People can take notes on the video, and the very same notes need to be retrieved.
